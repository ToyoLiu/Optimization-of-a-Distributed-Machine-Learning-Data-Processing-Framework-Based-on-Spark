### Optimization of a Distributed Machine Learning Data Processing Framework Based on Spark

**Brief Description:**  
Conducted a comprehensive optimization of a distributed machine learning data processing framework using Apache Spark, focusing on enhancing data collection, storage, processing, model training, inference, and evaluation efficiency.

**Time Period:**  
September 2023 - January 2024

**Tools:**  
Apache Spark, Python, MLlib, HDFS, Kafka, Docker

**Key Achievements:**
- Improved data processing efficiency by implementing strategies such as view materialization, operation rewriting, and data caching, resulting in significant speedup in large-scale data processing tasks.
- Enhanced model training processes using parallel and distributed computing, leveraging Spark's MLlib library for scalable machine learning algorithms.
- Optimized model inference performance through techniques like model compression, quantization, and knowledge distillation, achieving faster inference speeds and reduced storage requirements.
- Developed a comprehensive system for real-time and batch inference, utilizing Spark Streaming for real-time processing and Spark Batch for batch processing tasks.
